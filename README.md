### Part i

Remember the Bayes Dice app we build many weeks ago? Let's revisit that app, but with a twist.

You have 3 coins with the following probabilities. P(H|1) = 0.3, P(H|2) = 0.45, P(H|3) = 0.75.

That is read as the probability of heads for coin 1 is 30%, etc.

Write a small app, using Object Oriented Python, that allows you to randomly select a coin (without looking) and then repeatedly flip it about 10 times or so until you are fairly certain as to the type of coin you selected.
